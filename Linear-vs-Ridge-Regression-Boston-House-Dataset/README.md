The code file performs Linear and ridge regression ( without the use of inbuild libraries) on the Boston Housing Dataset.
It then finds the best lambda that can be used in ridge regression.
Further, we do a polynomial transformation of degree 2 on the features and predicts the housing values.

Finally, we run the best model obtained from above and predict a house price with given input features.
