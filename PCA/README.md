This file contains the code to perform prnciple component analysis for a given dataset and find the top components.

PCA is performed in two ways - 1.) by calculating the Singular Value Decomposition Matrix (SVD) and 2) by calculating the Eigen Vectors.

The code file shows how a movies vs user ratings by user can be reduced from 3-D to 2-D using PCA.

It is also shown square-root of the eigen-values of the covariance matrix correspond to the singular values of the data matrix.

We then load the faces data and perform PCA on it and the top 5 components are displayed.
